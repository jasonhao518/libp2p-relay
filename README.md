# libp2p-relay

Some projects of Threefold Tech or that Threefold Tech supports rely on [libp2p](https://libp2p.io) peer routing.
Libp2p ipfs DHT's for peer routing seems to provide unstable peer routing when bootstrapping through the public libp2p bootstrap nodes.

This project provides an implementation for relay nodes that can be used to provide reliable peer routing.
